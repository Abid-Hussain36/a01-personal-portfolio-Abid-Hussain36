      <p class="bio">
        Hi, I'm Abid, a senior at UNC Chapel Hill pursuing a B.S. in Computer
        Science. I am passionate about machine learning, AI, full stack
        development, and mobile development and am eager to pursue opportunities
        in these domains. Outside of work, I enjoy cooking, reading, and working
        out.
